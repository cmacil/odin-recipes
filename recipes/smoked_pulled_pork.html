<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This is going to take a while -- four to five hours to do it right. It's a waiting game while keeping temperatures relatively low, with indirect grilling and adding a little smokey flavor. You are going to need a charcoal-fired grill (we usually use a hamburger-shaped grill) or a smoker, plenty of charcoal, and wood chips soaking in water for smoke (beer for the chef). We also always use a dry rub, but it is not required.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 pork shoulder (Boston butt, 3.5 to 5 pounds)</li>
	<li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp mustard powder</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
	<li>1 Tbsp paprika</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Mix the above ingredients and use them to coat the cut of pork. </li>
	<li>Place the pork in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.</li>
	<li>Use a disposable aluminum drip pan in the center of the grill and place a handful or two of charcoal briquettes on each side of the pan. </li>
	<li>To get the grille started, use tongs to drop three or four red-hot charcoal briquettes on the briquettes on the four sides of the pan. </li>
	<li>Place the meat over the drip pan and use the bottom and top vents to regulate the temperature. </li>
	<li>You want an internal temp of 325-350 degrees. </li>
	<li>Every hour or so, you may need to add a few briquettes to each side of the pan.</li>
	<li>You can also add a few soaked wood chips, like apple or cherry wood. </li>
	<li>Once the center of the meat has reached an internal temperature of 195 degrees and the meat feels like it will fall apart, it is ready. </li>
	<li>Depending on how hot your grill has been and how large of a pork shoulder you are cooking, this can take 3-6 hours. </li>
	<li>Pull the meat off the heat carefully and place it in a large non-reactive cake pan. </li>
	<li>Cover with aluminum foil and wait an hour for it to cool off. </li>
	<li>When the meat is cool enough to touch, using clean hands, and a fork or two, pull the meat apart, drenching with the mop sauce as you go.</li>
