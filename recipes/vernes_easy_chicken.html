<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	A simple recipe for a quick meal! Stop off at a roadside supermarket, have the rear seat passengers mix up the marinade (they'd better watch the leather back there!), and have the navigator guard the soon-to-be-divine chicken. They should be able to get all of that done while you preheat the oven/engine on the way to the bbq ground. That's the hard part anyway!
