<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Getting carne asada right is all in the marinade and the cut of beef. We usually start with a flank steak, which is great as it has lots of flavor and is a relatively inexpensive cut. You can also use this marinade for chicken if you want, but make sure the chicken is cooked all the way through.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>3 to 4 cloves garlic chopped or pressed through a garlic press</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp chili powder</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Salt and pepper the steak while you make the marinade.</li>
